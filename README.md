# workday-calendar
In this challenge I was able to create a work day agenda based on the hour of the day. The agenda lets you know by the color of the text box whether the task in the agenda is a past, present, or future task. Also, I was able to use local storage so that when you use the save button next to the text box you can resfresh or close the page and still have your tasks you entered for that time slot.
